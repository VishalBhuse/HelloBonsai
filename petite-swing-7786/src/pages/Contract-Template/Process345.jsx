        You and your client should both have at least one copy of the originally
        signed contract and any formal documentation when required. Whether it’s
        an independent contractor agreement, partnership agreement, simple lease
        agreement, cleaning services agreement or rental agreement, any legally
        binding contract should be held by both parties in its original form.
        Photocopies are also a good idea – you never know when your original
        copy may be lost.

      <Text fontSize="18px" lineHeight="24px" fontWeight="400">
        Remember that for any major services or deals you should always include
        a lawyer or a notary. However, depending on the type of work you do,
        legal counsel isn’t always necessary when it comes to independent
        contractor contracts.
