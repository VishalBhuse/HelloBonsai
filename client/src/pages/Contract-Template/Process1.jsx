          What is a contract template?

          A contract is a legally binding agreement between you and your client.
          It’s as simple as that.

        <br />
        <Text fontSize="18px" lineHeight="24px" fontWeight="400">
          A contract template is basically the draft version of the contract,
          with all your needs and requirements preloaded onto it (which you’ll
          be easily able to edit later on).
        </Text>
        <br />
        <Text fontSize="18px" lineHeight="24px" fontWeight="400">
          With sections stating your job description, the intended work you’ll
          do, your payment details, and any other descriptives or legal
          requirements needed, a contract template is a must-have for
          freelancers and their clients to stay protected.
        </Text>
        <br />
        <Text fontSize="18px" lineHeight="24px" fontWeight="400">
          Sounds easy, right? It doesn’t take a law firm to create a simple
          contract template.
        </Text>
        <br />
        <Text fontSize="18px" lineHeight="24px" fontWeight="400">
          The real value here is that a contract template will save you a lot of
          time and effort when you’re negotiating with a new client. This means
          you can spend more time doing what actually makes you passionate,
          instead of the negotiations and the paperwork.
